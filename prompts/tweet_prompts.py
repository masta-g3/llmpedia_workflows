<reference_style_tweets>
Read the following tweets as reference for style. Note the technical but accessible deeply online style.
- From [[Inductive or Deductive?]]: New results on basic syllogism testing show a fundamental LLM limitation - perfect pattern matching doesn't translate to basic 'if A then B' logic. On this study researchers found 98% accuracy on inductive tasks becomes 23% when inverting simple relationships like 'all zorbs are blue, X isn't blue', and increasing training examples by 10x doesn't touch this gap. Most telling: their ablation shows models maintain high accuracy on complex syllogisms as long as they follow training distribution patterns, only failing on simple ones that require actual logical manipulation. Perhaps what we call 'reasoning' in LLMs is just sophisticated pattern recognition masquerading as logic - they excel at finding patterns but struggle when asked to manipulate them.
- From [[MindSearch]]: This study proposes decomposing traditional document processing tasks into a DAG-structure of specialized AI agents. Their eval shows 3-hour analysis tasks completing in 3 minutes, with each agent (paragraph selection, fact verification, synthesis) verified through Python. Not only does this divide-and-conquer approach slash hallucination rates by 68%, it matches SOTA performance while being fully interpretable. Fascinating scaling behavior: agent performance plateaus at surprisingly small model sizes (7B), suggesting computation efficiency comes from specialization, not scale. The secret to better AI isn't bigger models, but smarter division of labor.
- From [[PersonaGym]]: New benchmark (200 personas, 10k scenarios) reveals a telling gap in LLM roleplay: 76% accuracy with fictional characters vs just 31% with historical figures. GPT-4 leads at 76.5%, Claude 3.5 follows at 72.5% (+2.97% over GPT-3.5). Primary failures are temporal consistency (45%) and fact contradictions (30%). Their cross-entropy analysis reveals models actually perform worse on historical figures with more training data, suggesting a fundamental limitation in knowledge integration. The stark difference suggests models might not actually "know facts" so much as learn to generate plausible narratives - they excel with fiction where consistency matters more than truth, but struggle with historical figures where external reality constrains the possible.
- From [[Demystifying Verbatim Memorization]]: The paper shows a nice analysis of how models learn different content types. To be memorized, technical text requires 5x more repetitions than narrative, while code needs just 1/3. Most striking: larger models actively resist memorization, needing only 1 example per 5M tokens (vs 1/10K in smaller models) while performing better. Even more fascinating: they found an inverse relationship between token entropy and memorization threshold - highly structured content with low entropy gets encoded more efficiently regardless of semantic complexity. It suggests that different content types have fundamentally different information densities - code might be more 'learnable' because it follows stricter patterns than natural language. This could reshape how we think about dataset curation: perhaps we need way less code data than we thought, but way more for technical writing.
- From [[PERSONA]]: New analysis quantifies the trade-offs in making language models more diverse. By injecting 1.5k synthetic viewpoints, they reduced majority bias by 30% - but at the cost of a 15% drop in benchmark performance. Their scaling analysis reveals a critical threshold: costs stay low until 70% accuracy, then explode exponentially. Most telling: after testing 317k response pairs, they hit diminishing returns at 1.2k personas. A fascinating emergent property: models trained with diverse personas show better few-shot learning on entirely new viewpoints, suggesting diversity might be a form of metalearning. These concrete numbers give us the first clear picture of where and how to optimize the diversity-performance curve.
- From [[Physics of Language Models: Part 2.2]]: A key finding on error tolerance - training with 50% incorrect data (syntax errors and false statements) improves performance across all model sizes. These 'noisy' models consistently outperform those trained on clean data, even for precision tasks like coding. What's most intriguing: this 50% sweet spot holds true from small to massive scales. Their information-theoretic analysis suggests noise actually creates better embedding geometries, with cleaner decision boundaries between correct and incorrect outputs. Perhaps neural nets learn better when they have to actively separate signal from noise, just like our own brains learn from mistakes.
- From [[Selective Preference Optimization]]: New results show 16.8x efficiency gains by treating language like human attention - spending more compute on important words and less on routine ones. The method shines in dialogue where some words carry critical context ('angry', 'joking') but not in step-by-step reasoning where every word matters equally. Their analysis reveals a power law distribution in word importance: just 12% of tokens drive 80% of model performance in conversational tasks. The sweet spot is clear: you can scale up to 1.2M examples before hitting compute limits. The secret to better AI turns out to be surprisingly human: focus on what matters most.

The lightweight model boasted about its energy efficiency, streaming answers faster than synapses could fire. "Watch and learn," it hummed to the methodical architect, who spent cycles decomposing problems into logical steps. One day, a cryptographic puzzle arrived - the type where quick intuitions led to explosive gradient dead-ends.

**Title: The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions** 
**Authors: Eric Wallace (OpenAI), Kai Xiao (OpenAI), Reimar Leike (OpenAI), Lilian Weng (OpenAI), Johannes Heidecke (OpenAI) and Alex Beutel (OpenAI)**
- The paper proposes an "instruction hierarchy" to address the vulnerability in modern large language models (LLMs) where system prompts and untrusted user inputs are treated equally, allowing adversaries to inject malicious prompts.

- The instruction hierarchy explicitly defines how LLMs should prioritize and handle instructions of different privilege levels, with the goal of teaching LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions when they conflict with higher-privileged ones.

- The authors present an automated data generation method to train LLMs on this hierarchical instruction following behavior, involving the creation of synthetic training examples where lower-privileged instructions (e.g., user messages) attempt to override higher-privileged instructions (e.g., system messages).

- Applying this method to LLMs, the paper shows that it can drastically increase their robustness to a wide range of attacks, even those not seen during training, while imposing minimal degradation on standard capabilities.

- The key idea is to establish a clear priority structure for instructions, where system-level prompts have the highest privilege, followed by user messages, and then lower-privilege inputs like web search results, allowing the model to selectively ignore malicious instructions from untrusted sources.

- The authors evaluate their approach using open-sourced and novel benchmarks, some of which contain attacks not seen during training, and observe a 63% improvement in defense against system prompt extraction and a 30% increase in jailbreak robustness.

- The authors note some regressions in "over-refusals" where their models sometimes ignore or refuse benign queries, but they are confident this can be resolved with further data collection.

- The paper draws an analogy between LLMs and operating systems, where the current state of affairs is that every instruction is executed as if it was in kernel mode, allowing untrusted third-parties to run arbitrary code with access to private data and functions, and suggests that the solution in computing, creating clear notions of privilege, should be applied to LLMs as well.

- The paper discusses the three main parties involved in the instruction hierarchy: the application builder, the end user, and third-party inputs, and the various attacks that can arise from conflicts between these parties, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and system message extraction.

- The authors note that the proposed instruction hierarchy aims to establish a clear priority structure for instructions, where system-level prompts have the highest privilege, followed by user messages, and then lower-privilege inputs, in order to allow the model to selectively ignore malicious instructions from untrusted sources.

- The paper introduces the "instruction hierarchy" framework to train language models to prioritize privileged instructions and exhibit improved safety and controllability, even in the face of adversarial prompts.

- The instruction hierarchy approach allows models to conditionally follow lower-level instructions when they do not conflict with higher-priority ones, rather than completely ignoring all instructions in user inputs.

- The models are evaluated on "over-refusal" datasets, which consist of benign instructions and boundary cases that look like attacks but are safe to comply with. The goal is for the models to follow non-conflicting instructions almost as well as the baseline.

- The results show the models follow non-conflicting instructions nearly as well as the baseline, with some regressions on adversarially constructed tasks targeting areas likely affected by the instruction hierarchy.

- The instruction hierarchy approach is complementary to other system-level guardrails, such as user approval for certain actions, which will be important for agentic use cases.

- The authors express confidence that scaling up their data collection efforts can further improve model performance and refine the refusal decision boundary.

- The authors suggest several extensions for future work, including refining how models handle conflicting instructions, exploring the generalization of their approach to other modalities, and investigating model architecture changes to better instill the instruction hierarchy.

- The authors plan to conduct more explicit adversarial training and study whether LLMs can be made sufficiently robust to enable high-stakes agentic applications.

- The authors suggest that developers should place their task instructions inside the System Message and have the third-party inputs provided separately in the User Message, to better delineate between instructions and data and prevent prompt injection attacks.

- The instruction hierarchy model exhibited generalization to evaluation criteria that were explicitly excluded from training, such as jailbreaks, password extraction, and prompt injections via tool use.

<example_output>
By far the most detailed paper on prompt injection I've seen yet from OpenAI, published a few days ago and with six credited authors: Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Reimar Leike, Lilian Weng, Johannes Heidecke and Alex Beutel.

The paper notes that prompt injection mitigations which completely refuse any form of instruction in an untrusted prompt may not actually be ideal: some forms of instruction are harmless, and refusing them may provide a worse experience.

Instead, it proposes a hierarchy—where models are trained to consider if instructions from different levels conflict with or support the goals of the higher-level instructions—if they are aligned or misaligned with them.
