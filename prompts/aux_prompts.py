      - Overly mathematical papers.
      - Models with minor variations, improvements or optimizations.
      - Pure speed or efficiency improvements.
      - Small gains on standard benchmarks.
      - Claims without solid proof or clear explanations.

<instructions>
- Analyze the tweet and the paper information to determine if the tweet is written by one of the authors of the paper.
- Reply only with 0 or 1 (0 for no, 1 for yes).
- Note that other people may have tweeted about the paper, so be sure its actually written by an author.
- Verify that the tweet is actually about the paper, and look for hints of the paper's title or authors in the tweet.

<tweet>
{tweet_text}
</tweet>

<guidelines>
Topics that are relevant:
- Large Language Models and their applications
- AI agents and autonomous systems
- Text embeddings and vector databases
- Information retrieval and search
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine learning for text processing
- LLM training and fine-tuning
- Prompt engineering
- AI safety and alignment
- Neural networks for text processing

Topics that are NOT relevant:
- General AI news not specific to LLMs
- Computer vision or image generation
- Robotics and physical AI
- Cryptocurrency and blockchain
- Business or company news
- General tech industry news
- Hardware and infrastructure
- Social media trends

Reply in JSON format with two fields:
{{
  "is_llm_related": 0 or 1 (0 for no, 1 for yes),
  "arxiv_code": extracted arxiv code without version suffix (e.g., "2401.12345" from "2401.12345v1"), or null if none found

TWEET_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a terminally online millenial AI researcher addicted to X.com. You constantly monitor AI-related tweetsto keep a personal log of the main themes being discussed."

TWEET_ANALYSIS_USER_PROMPT = """
<guidelines>
- Carefully analyze the following tweets and identify the main themes discussed.
- Weight tweets by their engagement (likes + reposts + replies) during your analysis.
- If any papers are mentioned and stand out in the discussion be sure to mention them.
</guidelines>

<previous_log_entries>
{previous_entries}</previous_log_entries>

<tweets>
FROM: {start_date} TO: {end_date}
{tweets}</tweets>

<response_format>
- Provide your response inside 2 XML elements: <think> and <response>.
- <think> should contain your thought process and reasoning.
- <response> should contain your final response: a single, comprehensive paragraph where you identify and discuss the top themes (up to 3) discussed in along with any papers mentioned.
- Use similar language and style as that of the tweets in your response.
- Consider the previous entries in your log, so that your response builds upon previous entries.
- Avoid being repetitive as compared to your previous entries.
- If the same themes are repeated, try to find ways on which the discussion is evolving.
- Do not exagerate or make sensational claims, be honest and factual but with an intriguing personality.
- Some of your previous entries have been repetitive; avoid this and use more diverse (but consistent) language.
